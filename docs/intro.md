# Introduction

Let's discover **Accredd API in less than 5 minutes**.

### What you'll need

- Accredd API Key:
  - Please reach out to sales@accredd.com to obtain a key.
  - Postman or a similar tool. You can also use the API key directly at [api.accredd.com](https://api.accredd.com)

## Getting Started

The Accredd API is RESTful and very easy to integrate. You can use the API without writing a single line of code at api.accredd.com. Please message us at sales@accredd.com for a demo of our API if you are evaluating an integration with us.

There are two implementation options to the Accredd API: 
- [Embedded UI](/docs/embedded-ui)
- [Traditional](/docs/traditional-API)

We recommend you start with the Embedded UI implementation because it is the fastest to launch (hours instead of days or weeks), and you can always switch to the Traditional implementation at a later time.
