# Introduction

Let's discover **Accredd API in less than 5 minutes**.

### What you'll need

- Accredd API Key:
  - Please reach out to sales@accredd.com to obtain a key.
  - Postman or a similar tool. You can also use the API key directly at [api.accredd.com](https://api.accredd.com)

## Getting Started

The Accredd API is RESTful and very easy to integrate. You can use the API without writing a single line of code at api.accredd.com. Please message us at sales@accredd.com for a demo of our API if you are evaluating an integration with us.

There are two implementation options to the Accredd API: 
- Embedded UI 
- Traditional

We recommend you start with the Embedded UI implementation because it is the fastest to launch (hours instead of days or weeks), and you can always switch to the Traditional implementation at a later time.


## Authentication

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
